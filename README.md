<b>Let's plant a tree</b><br>
<em>by Aileen Fisher</em>

It’s time to plant a tree, a tree.<br>
What shall it be? What shall it be?

Let’s plant a pine—we can’t go wrong:<br>
a pine is green the whole year long.

Let’s plant a maple—more than one,<br>
to shade us from the summer sun.

Let’s plant a cherry—you know why:<br>
there’s nothing like a cherry pie!

Let’s plant an elm, the tree of grace,<br>
where robins find a nesting place.

Let’s plant an apple—not too small,<br>
with flowers in spring and fruit in fall.

Let’s plant a fir—so it can be<br>
a lighted outdoor Christmas tree.

Let’s plant a birch, an oak, a beech,<br>
there’s something extra-nice in each…<br>
in winter, summer, spring or fall.<br>
Let’s plant a…

why not plant them ALL?
